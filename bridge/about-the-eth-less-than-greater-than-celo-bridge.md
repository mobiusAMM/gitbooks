# OPTICS

## Overview

For the past year the Optics team at Celo has been working incredibly hard to bring a superior cross-chain messaging standards for which **trustless** token bridges can be built on. We are excited to see that OPTICS and initial bridges from Celo to Ethereum and Polygon are finally here! 

To see the deployed contracts on mainnet, please refer to their Github and blockscout.

## An user interface for Optics

Although the contracts are live, their GUI is still in development. That said, we weren't going to let Mobius users waiting so we have developed our own bridge UI, that will support both Ethereum and Polygon bridges on Optics.  With a simple swapping interface, any user get go to mobius bridge tab and swap their Ethereum or Polygon assets to Celo and vice versa. 

## Confirmations

It takes an average transfer from Ethereum or Polygon **roughly 4 hours** to get to Celo.

## Costs

For a transfer of 10K, it costs $200 USD in ETH.
