# MobiusDAO

## A decentralized autonomous organization.

With launch of the Mobius governance token, the Mobius protocol will officially be formed into a DAO and holders will be encouraged to participate in the direction of the protocol. That said, for the time being, the admin keys at the moment are centralized to have control over the short term roadmap and maintain the integrity of the protocol while its TVL and community is still in its infancy. We do have every intention to hand over the keys to the community though, and have decentralizing the DAO on our roadmap!

## Admin Keys

{% hint style="info" %}
The Mobius admin keys are controlled by a 3/4 multisig. The signers are Dylan Mooers, Kyle Scott, Robert Leifke, and Eric Cuellar. This multisig has capabilities to pause new deposits and trades in case of technical emergencies. Users will always be able to withdraw their funds regardless of new deposits being paused. The multisig can also change the swap fees.
