# Wallet support

## Desktop

Initially wallet support will be limited to MetaMask, Celo Extension Wallet, and Ledger. That said, we are actively working to integrate with wallet connect, and more wallets as they come. Feel free to send us a message on discord as well, if there is particular wallet you would like to see.
