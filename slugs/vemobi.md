## **Staking and the veMOBI token** <a id="eeb9"></a>

veMOBI stands for "vote-escrow" MOBI and will be similar to veCRV in that token holders receive boosted rewards in return for staking their MOBI tokens over a fixed period. This is done by design to encourage participation in governance. Unlike MOBI, veMOBI earns token holders 3x the rewards from the inflation schedule and if the community sees fit, could potentially earn from trading fees.

Locking period = 1â€“4 years

## Inflation and the Gauge system <a id="2ee7"></a>

In an effort to decentralize the weighting of the pool rewards and incentivize users for providing liquidity, Mobius has adopted a gauge system. Traditionally inflation goes directly to LPs which is then measured by a gauge. For veMOBI holders, the additional rewards they receive are calculated by the amount of liquidity the user is providing in the pool gauge relative to the total amount of liquidity provided and their veMOBI voting power.

> \(Current pool gauge liquidity / Total amount of liquidity provided\) + The fraction of voting power that the veMOBI constitutes out of the total.

As an added benefit, holders of veMOBI can also vote on the rewards allocation to the pools of their choice.

### Release Schedule <a id="b410"></a>

MOBI tokens will be minted following an exponential decay release schedule. You can see the release schedule for each category below:
