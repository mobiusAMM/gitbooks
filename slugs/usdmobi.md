# $MOBI



> $MOBI is a governance token that has voting rights in the MobiusDAO. This article covers how the token will be minted, distributed, and put to work across the Celo ecosystem.

### Community-driven Fair Launch <a id="b282"></a>

We decided to skip the VCs and allocate a larger portion to the community and the greater Celo ecosystem as a whole. This means greater yield, decentralization, and control for Mobius users. To thank our early liquidity providers \(LPs\), we have decided to do a small airdrop of 5M tokens to those who deposited more than $10.

## Yield Farming <a id="c3b5"></a>

On [September 17th, 2021](https://www.mobius.money/#/pool) the initial issuance of 75M tokens was sent to the set liquidity mining pools. These funds are being used to kick-start our liquidity mining program on the following pools:![](https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*cpTqemvEuF-bZeOdjGYTfg@2x.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*cpTqemvEuF-bZeOdjGYTfg@2x.png)

At a high level, this equals 80% for tokens bridged via [Optics](https://medium.com/celoorg/announcing-optics-a-gas-efficient-interoperability-standard-for-cross-chain-communication-e597163b2) and 20% those bridged via [Moss Earth](http://bridge.moss.earth/).

## **Token Distribution** <a id="5dd4"></a>

Looking to emulate the success of some most active communities in DeFi, Mobius is adopting a standard token distribution.

The MobiusDAO will deploy the MOBI token contract on **September 17, 2021** with a max supply of 1,000,000,000 MOBI and the following distribution characteristics.![](https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*RgH80ddD_88FDQ_-IVKErg@2x.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*RgH80ddD_88FDQ_-IVKErg@2x.png)

### Liquidity Mining <a id="2ed4"></a>

To kickstart yield farming on Mobius and entice deep liquidity, 8% of the token supply will be initially released to incentivize current and new pools over the liquidity mining period. **This equates to 500,000 MOBI per week.**

### Mining Reserve <a id="641c"></a>

Making sure that Mobius pools are properly liquid so users are getting the most efficient low slippage trades will be critical to Mobius’s success. Therefore we are allocating the largest share of the tokens to ensure that liquidity providers are thoroughly incentivized. Thereby the solvency of the various pools.

### Partnerships and Ecosystem <a id="3d93"></a>

As the first AMM optimized for similarly priced assets on Celo, we feel that Mobius can be a foundational building block to the ever expanding DeFi ecosystem on Celo. Even to the same degree that others have for their respective ecosystems. That is why it is critical that MobiusDAO does everything it can to help support and kickstart projects on top of Mobius. Aligning incentives with proper funding will be a key part of that!

Being built on a mission driven smart contract platform, we will propose to the community that the MobiusDAO allocate a portion of the partnership and ecosystem tokens to [ImpactMarket](https://www.impactmarket.com/). Since its launch last year, the protocol has been responsible for over $1M in UBI grants to some of the most impoverished communities and families around the world.

The ecosystem allocation will also fund more audits for the Mobius protocol, projects looking to build on top of Mobius, and emergency situations.

### The Celo Reserve <a id="829e"></a>

Like many other Celo projects, Mobius will follow suit by allocating a portion of the tokens to the Celo reserve. The reserve is aimed to be an over-collateralized basket of crypto assets that maintain the peg of Celo’s assortment of decentralized stablecoins. Allocating to the reserve will achieve two purposes; \(1\) ensuring there is always worth of the tokens, \(2\) being vested in Celo’s stability mechanism.

### Team & Advisors <a id="da40"></a>

In an effort to reward the initial team with building the beginnings of Mobius and oversee its continued development and growth, a portion of the tokens will be allocated to the current Mobius team, future employees, and our fantastic advisors **vested over one year**.![](https://miro.medium.com/max/30/1*uqYlbs3X1jAsvhi7PnC24Q.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*uqYlbs3X1jAsvhi7PnC24Q.png)
